Reinforcement Learning (RL) is particularly well-suited for Physical AI systems where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with the physical environment. The agent learns optimal behaviors through trial and error, guided by reward signals from the environment.

## Hands-On Activity: RL Agent for Control
In this activity, you will implement a reinforcement learning agent to control a physical system.

### What You'll Need
- Computer with internet access
- RL framework
- Physical system simulator

### Steps
1. Define the environment and state space
2. Design appropriate reward functions
3. Implement RL algorithm
4. Train and test the agent

## Expected Outputs & Validation Criteria
- Successfully train an RL agent
- Demonstrate improved performance over time
- Understand RL application to physical systems

## Reflection Questions
- How do you design reward functions for physical systems?
- What challenges arise when applying RL to real physical systems?

## Follow-Up Exploration Tasks
- Research model-free vs. model-based RL methods
- Explore deep RL techniques for complex systems

## Glossary Items Introduced
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
