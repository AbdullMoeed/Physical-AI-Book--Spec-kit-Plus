Before starting with the Physical AI Book, you should have:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Familiarity with a programming language (preferably Python or JavaScript)
- Basic understanding of electronics concepts (voltage, current, circuits)
- Access to a computer with internet connection
- Willingness to learn through hands-on experimentation

No advanced knowledge is required - we'll build your skills progressively from the basics.
