Connecting sensors to processing systems requires understanding communication protocols and electrical interfaces. Common protocols include I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). Each has advantages and trade-offs in terms of speed, complexity, and number of pins required.
