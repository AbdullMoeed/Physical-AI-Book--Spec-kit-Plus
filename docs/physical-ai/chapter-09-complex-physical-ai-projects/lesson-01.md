Designing complex Physical AI projects requires careful planning to integrate sensing, processing, and actuation components effectively. This involves understanding system requirements, identifying constraints, and planning the integration of multiple technologies into a cohesive solution.

## Hands-On Activity: System Design Project
In this activity, you will design a complete Physical AI system addressing a real-world problem.

### What You'll Need
- Computer with design tools
- Requirements documentation
- System architecture templates

### Steps
1. Define the problem and requirements
2. Identify system components and interactions
3. Design the system architecture
4. Plan implementation phases

## Expected Outputs & Validation Criteria
- Complete system design documentation
- Clear component specifications
- Feasible implementation plan

## Reflection Questions
- How do you balance functionality with resource constraints?
- What tools help plan complex Physical AI projects effectively?

## Follow-Up Exploration Tasks
- Research system design methodologies
- Explore project management tools for technical projects

## Glossary Items Introduced
- System Requirements: Specifications that define what a system must do
- System Architecture: The fundamental structure of a system

## Common Mistakes & Fixes
- Incomplete requirements analysis: Use systematic approaches to identify all requirements
- Ignoring integration challenges: Plan for component integration early in design

## Safety and Ethical Considerations
- Plan safety requirements into the system design
- Consider ethical implications of the system design
