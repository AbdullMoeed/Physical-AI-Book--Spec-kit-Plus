Connected Physical AI systems are vulnerable to security threats and privacy breaches. Implementing robust security measures, including device authentication, data encryption, and privacy protection, is essential for maintaining system integrity and user trust.

## Hands-On Activity: Secure Communication Implementation
In this activity, you will implement secure communication channels for a Physical AI system.

### What You'll Need
- Computer with internet access
- Security libraries
- Certificate management tools

### Steps
1. Implement device authentication
2. Set up encrypted communication channels
3. Test security against common vulnerabilities
4. Validate privacy protection measures

## Expected Outputs & Validation Criteria
- Successfully implement secure communication
- Demonstrate protection against common threats
- Ensure user privacy is maintained

## Reflection Questions
- What are the most critical security considerations for Physical AI systems?
- How do you balance security with system performance?

## Follow-Up Exploration Tasks
- Research certificate-based authentication
