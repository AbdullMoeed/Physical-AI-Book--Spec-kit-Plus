Voice-activated systems allow users to control Physical AI devices through spoken commands. This requires integrating speech recognition with the system's control logic, handling ambiguous commands, and ensuring reliable operation in various acoustic environments.

## Hands-On Activity: Voice-Controlled Device
In this activity, you will implement a voice-controlled Physical AI system.

### What You'll Need
- Computer with internet access
- Audio input simulation
- Virtual actuator system

### Steps
1. Implement speech recognition pipeline
2. Design command parsing system
3. Integrate with actuator control
4. Test voice interface robustness

## Expected Outputs & Validation Criteria
- Successfully implement voice control system
- Recognize and execute voice commands
- Handle ambiguous or unclear commands appropriately

## Reflection Questions
- How do you design voice interfaces that are intuitive and reliable?
- What strategies help handle ambiguous voice commands?

## Follow-Up Exploration Tasks
- Research natural language understanding for command interpretation
- Explore multimodal interfaces combining voice and other inputs

## Glossary Items Introduced
- Voice Interface: A user interface that responds to spoken commands
- Command Parsing: Interpreting spoken commands into system actions

## Common Mistakes & Fixes
- Misinterpreting background noise as commands: Implement proper wake word detection
- Unreliable command execution: Add confirmation steps for critical commands

## Safety and Ethical Considerations
- Ensure voice data is processed securely
- Consider the impact of voice-controlled systems on privacy
