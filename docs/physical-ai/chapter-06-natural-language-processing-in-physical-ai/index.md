# Chapter 6: Natural Language Processing in Physical AI

This chapter explores how NLP can be integrated into physical AI systems, allowing for voice commands and text-based interactions with physical devices.

## Overview

Natural language processing (NLP) enables Physical AI systems to understand and respond to human language. This chapter examines techniques for implementing NLP on physical devices, including speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech capabilities, with considerations for resource-constrained environments.
